<b>Study Samples <br></b>
We have a colony of <i>Hdac1<sup> fl/fl</sup> Hdac2<sup> fl/fl</sup></i> mice developed by Dr. Eric Olson [PMID: 17639084](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17639084/).  These mice were bred for multiple generations with doxycycline-inducible Pax8-reverse tetracycline transactivator (rtTA) and the bicistronic Cre (LC-1) hemizygous mice. Control mice are homozygous floxed for <i> Hdac1 and Hdac2 </i> but are Pax8-rtTA/LC-1 negative.  Knockdown mice are homozygous floxed for <i> Hdac1 and Hdac2 </i> and are Pax8-rtTA/LC-1 hemizygous.  Induction of kidney epithelial knockdown occured at 6 weeks of age by providing doxcyline water for 7 days followed by 7 days of tap water.  Male and female mice were euthanized and kidney samples collected for histological and single nucleus analyses.
